To Do:

2/6/2017:
-fix login button layouts
-get register area set up
-set up auth with Passport
-set up mongo db
-make page work.
-Should the user be able to play with it, then if they want
    to save data the need to register?
-Use email addresses to register?  Makes it easy to be unique, but then we
    have to deal with verifying the address.
-With username we need to check for uniqueness.
-password complexity...
